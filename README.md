## 📌 About the Project

**CitizenssApp**, is a low-code/no-code framework designed to let individuals and communities define, own, and operate their own applications. It uses:

- 📋 **Metadata Execution Contracts (MEC)** to define logic, views, and data
- 💬 **Prompt Engineering** for natural language–driven app creation
- 🧱 **Decentralized Entity Architecture (DEA)** for modular ERP components
- 🔐 **Storage independence**, allowing data to be saved locally, on cloud, or as files
- 🔄 **Record-level sharing**, enabling secure communication between citizens

This repository hosts the Proof-of-Concept (POC) source code, examples, templates, and plugin definitions.
